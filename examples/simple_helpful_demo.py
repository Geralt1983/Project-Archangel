**Implementation Framework:**
1. **Baseline Establishment**: 7mg patch provides stable 10-15ng/ml plasma levels over 16-24 hours
2. **Strategic Enhancement**: 2mg gum adds 5-10ng/ml peaks within 30 minutes for targeted focus
3. **Timing Protocol**: Gum 30 minutes before high-concentration tasks, maximum 4 pieces daily
4. **Performance Tracking**: Monitor focus duration, task completion rates, cognitive metrics

**Daily Schedule:**
- 7:00 AM: Apply fresh patch (rotate sites: upper arm, torso)
- 9:30 AM: First gum piece before morning focus session  
- 2:00 PM: Optional second piece for afternoon tasks
- 6:00 PM: Avoid gum after this time to preserve sleep

**Health Monitoring & Safety Integration:**
- Maximum daily nicotine: 14mg total (7mg patch + 8mg gum max)
- Track: Heart rate, sleep quality, cognitive performance, side effects
- Tolerance indicators: Reduced effectiveness, increased cravings
- Healthcare consultation: If using >12 weeks or experiencing adverse effects

**Evidence Basis:**
Based on pharmacokinetic studies (Benowitz et al., 2009) and cognitive enhancement research (Heishman et al., 2010) showing optimal performance at 2-4mg nicotine doses with established safety profiles within recommended limits.

**Optimization Metrics:**
- Focus session duration and quality (1-10 scale)  
- Task completion percentage
- Sleep onset time and quality
- Adjust timing/frequency based on tracked effectiveness data"""
