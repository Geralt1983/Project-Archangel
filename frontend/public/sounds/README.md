# Sound Files

This directory contains sound files for the Project Archangel frontend.

## Required Files

- `boing.mp3` - Sound played when bumping a task (optional)

## Note

Sound files are optional. The application will work without them, but audio feedback enhances the user experience.

You can add your own `boing.mp3` file here for the bump sound effect.
