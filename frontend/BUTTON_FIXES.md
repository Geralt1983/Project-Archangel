# Button Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Event Propagation Problem
- **Problem**: `SortableTaskCard` drag listeners were preventing button clicks
- **Fix**: Modified event filtering to not call `preventDefault()` on buttons, allowing normal click behavior

### 2. Missing Sound File
- **Problem**: Bump button tried to play `/sounds/boing.mp3` which didn't exist
- **Fix**: Added error handling to gracefully fail when sound file is missing
- **Note**: Created `public/sounds/` directory with README for optional sound files

### 3. Button Click Handlers
- **Problem**: Click events weren't properly isolated from drag events
- **Fix**: 
  - Added `data-no-drag` attribute to all buttons
  - Added `preventDefault()` to button click handlers  
  - Added `pointer-events-auto` to button container
  - Improved element reference in burn animation

## Changes Made

### `components/sortable-task-card.tsx`
- Modified drag event filtering to allow button clicks while preventing drag

### `components/task-card.tsx`
- Enhanced `handleBumpClick()` with sound error handling
- Enhanced `handleBurnClick()` with better element reference
- Added `data-no-drag` attributes to all action buttons
- Added `pointer-events-auto` class to button container

### `public/sounds/`
- Created directory with README for optional sound files

## Testing

The frontend is now running at `http://localhost:3000`

### To Test Buttons:
1. Navigate to the main board page
2. Look for task cards with "Bump" and "Burn" buttons
3. Click buttons to verify they trigger the expected actions:
   - **Bump**: Should move task to "Doing" column with animation
   - **Burn**: Should show fire animation and remove task after 1.4 seconds

### Expected Console Output:
```
[v0] TaskCard handleBumpClick called for task: [task-id]
[v0] Calling onBump with task ID and element
[v0] handleBump called with taskId: [task-id]
```

```
[v0] TaskCard handleBurnClick called for task: [task-id]
[v0] Calling onBurn for task: [task-id]
[v0] handleBurn called with taskId: [task-id]
```

## Notes

- Sound effects are optional - the app works without them
- Button animations include visual feedback (elevation, ember effects)
- WIP limits are enforced for bump operations
- All button interactions are properly logged for debugging
