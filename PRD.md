# Project Archangel - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

**Project Archangel** is an AI-powered task orchestration platform that intelligently distributes workload across multiple task management providers (ClickUp, Trello, Todoist) using advanced scoring algorithms and reliability patterns. The system optimizes productivity by automatically balancing tasks based on urgency, importance, effort, and SLA requirements while ensuring exactly-once delivery and fault tolerance.

## Product Vision
